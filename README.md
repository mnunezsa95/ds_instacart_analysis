# Instacart Analysis

## Overview
This project provides insights into consumer shopping behaviors on Instacart, derived from a dataset containing information on 157,437 unique individuals. It highlights patterns in shopping times, order frequencies, and popular items purchased through an application, potentially Instacart.

## Description
The dataset offers valuable information on shopping habits, encompassing the times when individuals make purchases, the frequency of orders, and the types of items commonly bought.

## Objectives
- To analyze shopping behaviors, including preferred shopping times and order frequencies.
- To identify popular items frequently purchased by users.
- To draw conclusions about shopping habits and preferences based on the data.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals that customers tend to shop between approximately 7:00 AM and 9:00 PM, with Mondays and Tuesdays showing higher order numbers compared to other days of the week. Despite slight variations, order frequencies remain relatively consistent from Wednesday to Sunday. On average, customers purchase 8-10 items per order, suggesting that the application is often used for smaller, more immediate needs rather than comprehensive grocery shopping.

## Libraries
The analysis utilizes various Python libraries, including but not limited to:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
